There are my newly factored dotfiles. This format was clearly
influenced from https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles

I decided to follow this factored method because I thought it would
help with keeping track of what settings were defined on various
systems I use, Mac and Linux, home and work. many of the files end in
*.osx or *.linux so that they are loaded only when in that operating
system.

This directory should be placed in ~/.dotfiles to work correctly. To
run first run the command
source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

I also have a separate set of files, structured similarly, in the
directory ~/.work-dotfiles . This directory contains all the stuff you
don't want Github to see.
