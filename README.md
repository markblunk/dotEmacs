There are my newly factored dotfiles. This format was clearly
influenced from https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles

I decided to follow this factored method because I thought it would
help with keeping track of what settings were defined on various
systems I use, Mac and Linux, home and work. many of the files end in
*.osx or *.linux so that they are loaded only when in that operating
system.

This directory should be placed in ~/.dotfiles to work correctly. Then
`source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh` to set up.
